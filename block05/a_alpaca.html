                        <p>Baby is a really niave and attention seeking alpaca, hence his name. You can always find him bumping into things, including you...</p>

                        <p>Cookie is really sweet! He is always willing to give you cute gifts, but crumbles at the sight of rejection; be sure to always accept his offerings or you will pay the consequences.</p>

                        <p>Fergie is fergalicious, like the artist! Shes very sassy and independent, but loves to be pampered. So if you arent giving her what she wants, leave her alone or else you'll get bit.</p>
